            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Programming is often seen as a complex and technical field, dominated by intricate syntax and obscure commands. However, the essence of programming goes beyond just writing code. At its core, programming is about solving problems, thinking logically, and designing algorithms. By focusing on these fundamental skills, we can teach programming concepts without actually writing code, making it accessible and engaging for beginners. Here’s a detailed guide on how to achieve this.
